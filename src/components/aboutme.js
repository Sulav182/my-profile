                <p>I completed my undergraduate studies from Texas Tech University and I have been working as a software engineer. I love to learn whether it is a book, a musical instrument or a new programming language.</p>

                    <h2>Books</h2>
                    <p>I mostly read science fiction books, but occasionally read about history and evolution. My favorite books include Harry Potter and Dune series. My current reading list include Guns, Germs and Steel, and Foundation.</p>
